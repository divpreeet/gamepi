## 10/4/2025 7 AM - setup repo  

nothing really, just setup github, and wanted to get this project up and running, i have done a hardware project like hackpad before, so i hope this one wont be that mind boggling! i still need to find out the software i am going to be using, since i am on linux!

## 10/4/2025 9 AM - setup schematics  

setup kicad and added buttons, i've also made a parts list, and the est price is about 100$ which i think is alot, i might have to make the screen a bit worse.. also i couldnt find a symbol for the elecrow display, tried making my own, but failed miserably + wasted a shit ton of time on it. added the pi and button layout, need to wire and add other symbols too. but i need to study now.
